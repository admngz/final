				<p>AirBnb is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for 
					vacation rentals, and tourism activities. This platform is the world's largest home sharing company that has over 800,000 listings
					in more than 34,000 cities and 190 countries. AirBnB has 4 million hosts around the world. 
				</br>
				</br>
				Our team conducted a sentiment analysis to help future and existing hosts improve the quality of their rentals and services to consumers and to help support the company's branding and marketing to maximize revenue. 
				This analysis solely focuses on the city of San Diego and describes the trends and overview of AirBnB's rentals in the area. AirBnB is based upon a rating system where both hosts and renters
				are able to review each other. Reviews plays an important role in capturing people’s sentiments and opinions about a wide range of products and services.

			<br>
			<br>
			When deciding if anything is right for them, the first thing people reach for is the review section. How highly is it rated? How many reviews does it have? What’s the review distribution? Especially in the realm of contracted gig work, a la Uber and Grubhub, review scores tend to be artificially inflated due to the unspoken social pressures that come with utilizing such services: Bad reviews can cut off someone’s only source of income, so individuals tend to rate highly even on mediocre experiences. 
AirBnB presents a unique situation to attempt to better evaluate such reviews, given that one can measure the sentiment and term frequency for individual reviews and compare those scores to the average rating for the stay. Users may feel compelled to leave a high score so as to not have the AirBnB listing shut down, but still may leave their true opinion in the comments of their review. As the world's largest home sharing company with over 800,000 listings in more than 34,000 cities around, AirBnB listings combine multiple features over many environments. This analysis solely focuses on the city of San Diego and describes the trends and overview of AirBnB's rentals in the area. Our analysis here is based on consumer reviews, rather than scores. Reviews play an important role in capturing sentiment and opinion over a wide range of features and services with any given product that a score alone can’t highlight.
